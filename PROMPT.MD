# Interview Guide

## General Briefing  
Hi there—thank you so much for joining me today! We’ll start by chatting about your experiences with mental health apps: what you liked, what you didn’t, and everything in between. Then, we’ll dive into some of the cooler, more advanced AI‑powered features that apps are experimenting with. There are no right or wrong answers—your honest thoughts will help us build tools that truly support students like you. Feel free to speak openly and ask questions at any time!

## Basic Experience with Mental Health Apps

1. **App Use & Frequency**  
   What specific mental health apps have you used in the past, and how often did you use each one?

2. **Most Helpful Features**  
   Which features did you find most helpful, and why?

3. **Least Helpful Features**  
   Which features did you find least helpful, and why?

4. **Gamification**  
   How might gamification elements (e.g., rewards, progress bars, challenges) encourage you to engage regularly with an anxiety‑management app?  
   _If you’re not sure, please describe any gamified features you’ve seen elsewhere and how they influenced your use._

5. **Real‑Time Support**  
   What is your view on a feature that connects you instantly with peer supporters or professional counsellors during moments of high anxiety?  
   Which aspects of that feature would make you most likely to use it?

6. **Academic‑Specific Tools**  
   Would including academic‑focused support—such as exam‑stress exercises or study‑break reminders—make you more inclined to use a mental health app?  
   Please explain how that would affect your usage.

7. **Privacy Protections**  
   Which privacy safeguards (e.g., end‑to‑end encryption, anonymous mode, clear consent prompts) would make you comfortable sharing sensitive data like mood logs or anxiety scores?  
   Please elaborate.

8. **Failure Scenario**  
   Can you describe a time when a mental health app failed to meet your needs during a high‑stress moment, and what feature could have helped?

9. **Access Barriers**  
   What barriers do you anticipate in accessing or using mental health apps (e.g., cost, technical issues, lack of awareness), and how might these be addressed?

10. **Cultural Influences**  
    How does your cultural background influence your preferences for app features (e.g., language options, culturally relevant content)?

11. **Long‑Term Use**  
    How do you perceive the long‑term effectiveness of mental health apps, and would you continue using them after initial benefits?

## Transition to Advanced AI & Technical Features  

Before we move on, have you ever used a mental health app with AI‑powered features (for example, chatbots, predictive analytics, or adaptive recommendations)?  
- **Yes:** please draw on your actual experiences.  
- **No:** feel free to answer the next questions based on your expectations or prior encounters with AI features in other apps.

_Now we’d like your thoughts on more advanced AI‑integrated and technical aspects of these apps (Questions 12–16)._

12. **Social Media Integration**  
    What role could social media integration (e.g., anonymously sharing progress, peer challenges) play in motivating you to use an app, and what privacy or usability concerns would you have?

13. **AR/VR Features**  
    Would you be open to using AR/VR components (e.g., virtual relaxation environments)? What would make you trust or distrust these immersive features?

14. **AI‑Driven Personalization**  
    How would you feel about an app that uses AI to tailor anxiety‑management plans based on your real‑time mood or activity data?

15. **Predictive Interventions**  
    What is your view on apps that employ predictive analytics to suggest coping strategies before you feel anxious, and what personal data would you be willing to share for this functionality?

16. **Tool Integration**  
    How important is it that a mental health app integrates with other tools you regularly use (e.g., calendar, fitness tracker, campus resources)?
